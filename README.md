# tst
`tst` is a very small speedrun timer for the terminal written in c. it should
work on any system with `termios.h` and `unistd.h`.

# features
as of now, pretty much nothing. you can press space to display the time
since program duration, or q to exit.

# disclaimer
using this is probably a bad idea
